# Drowsiness Detection

This project, developed as part of my final year at Perbanas Institute, harnesses the power of computer vision by seamlessly integrating OpenCV and Mediapipe. It focuses on calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to effectively identify signs of drowsiness.

By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, this system monitors and analyzes the behavior of the eyes in real-time. The Eye Aspect Ratio serves as a crucial metric for detecting drooping eyelids or prolonged eye closure, signaling potential fatigue or drowsiness in individuals.

Through this project, I aim to contribute to enhancing safety measures, particularly in contexts where vigilance is critical, such as driving or operating machinery.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the depedencies. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
